# Repl.it_DissapearingRickRoll

This will run a shell script designed for Repl.it that will "Rick Roll" the first user that runs the Repl and then it will erase all evidence.
It is meant for educational purposes and for a small prank. Enjoy!

## Preparation Instructions 
1. Download it using the Repl.it terminal
```
$ git clone https://github.com/doprz/Repl.it_DissapearingRickRoll.git
```
2. cd into the directory
```
$ cd Repl.it_DissapearingRickRoll/
```
3. Change Permissions of `startup.sh` to executable
```
$ chmod +x startup.sh
```
4. Run `startup.sh`
```
$ ./startup.sh
```
5. Now the next person that runs the Repl by using the green run button will activate the Rick Roll Script

## Full One-Liner
```
git clone  https://github.com/doprz/Repl.it_DissapearingRickRoll.git && cd Repl.it_DissapearingRickRoll/ ; chmod +x startup.sh && ./startup.sh ; clear
```
